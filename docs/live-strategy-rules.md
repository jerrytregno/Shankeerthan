# Live strategies: entry and exit rules (reference)

Reference only. This describes what the live server bot does as of 1 Oct 2026. Nothing here changes the code.

All times are IST. "Nifty" means the NIFTY 50 spot index. "WS" means the Zerodha Kite websocket (live tick feed). All examples use a Nifty lot size of 65.

---

## 0. The big picture

The server runs two independent morning trades on the same bot:

| | 9:15 trade | 9:16 trade |
|---|---|---|
| What it reads | The first 10 seconds of the 9:15 minute | The full 9:15 minute (open to close) |
| When it buys | 9:15:11 | 9:16:01 |
| Red signal | Drop of 5 points or more → buy ATM PE | Drop of 15 points or more → buy ATM PE |
| Green signal | Rise of 10 points or more → buy ATM CE | Rise of 15 points or more → buy ATM CE |
| Order type | Market buy | Market buy |
| Main exit | Take-profit limit sell | Take-profit limit sell plus a Nifty index exit |

A day can have no trade, only the 9:15 trade, only the 9:16 trade, or both, one after the other. The two can never be open together. If the 9:15 trade is still open at 9:16:00, the 9:16 trade is skipped for the day (with one exception, see 1.10).

Traps, the later-session strategy, is a separate bot and is currently switched off on the server. It is not covered here.

### Terms used in this document

- **Open (9:15 open):** the first Nifty WS tick from 9:15:00 onwards (must arrive by 9:15:15).
- **Mark (9:15:10 read):** the last Nifty WS tick strictly before 9:15:10. A tick at 9:15:09.98 counts; a tick at 9:15:10.02 does not.
- **9:15 close (for the 9:16 entry):** the last Nifty WS tick strictly before 9:16:00.
- **Δ (delta):** 9:15 close − 9:15 open. Negative means a red candle, positive means green.
- **ATM:** the at-the-money strike, meaning the Nifty strike nearest the current spot.
- **Entry spot:** the Nifty level at the moment the option buy fills. All index-based exits are measured from this number.
- **Capital deployed:** average option entry price × quantity. Take-profit % is always measured on this, never on the Nifty index.
- **₹0.05 tick:** NSE option prices move in steps of ₹0.05, so every limit price is rounded to the nearest ₹0.05.

## 1. The 9:15 trade (PE or CE at 9:15:11)

### 1.1 Step 1: capture the 9:15 open

From 9:15:00 the bot listens to the Nifty websocket. The first tick it receives is locked as the 9:15 open.

If no tick arrives between 9:15:00 and 9:15:15, there is no 9:15 trade that day.

> Example: the first tick after 9:15:00 arrives at 9:15:00.21 with Nifty at 24,000.00. **Open = 24,000.00.**

### 1.2 Step 2: pre-resolve both options at 9:15:04

At 9:15:04 the bot uses the live Nifty spot to look up the ATM CE and ATM PE contracts. It also warms them up, so that at 9:15:11 it only has to place the order.

The first order attempt uses this strike even if Nifty has moved a little since 9:15:04. Retries look the strike up again from the latest spot.

> Example: spot at 9:15:04 is 24,003 → ATM strike 24,000 → contracts NIFTY…24000CE and NIFTY…24000PE are ready.

### 1.3 Step 3: read the direction at 9:15:10

The bot compares the mark (last tick before 9:15:10) with the open:

| Read at 9:15:10 | Rule | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Red, drop ≥ 5 points | open − mark ≥ 5 | Buy ATM **PE** at 9:15:11 |
| Green, rise ≥ 10 points | mark − open ≥ 10 | Buy ATM **CE** at 9:15:11 |
| Red but drop < 5 | | No 9:15 trade |
| Green but rise < 10 | | No 9:15 trade |
| Flat (mark = open) | | No 9:15 trade |

Note that green needs a bigger move (10 points) than red (5 points).

> Examples (open = 24,000.00):
>
> | Mark (last tick before 9:15:10) | Move | Decision |
> |---|---|---|
> | 23,993.50 | Red by 6.50 | **Buy PE** |
> | 23,995.00 | Red by exactly 5.00 | **Buy PE** (5 is enough) |
> | 23,996.00 | Red by 4.00 | No trade |
> | 24,011.20 | Green by 11.20 | **Buy CE** |
> | 24,010.00 | Green by exactly 10.00 | **Buy CE** (10 is enough) |
> | 24,007.00 | Green by 7.00 | No trade (green needs 10) |
> | 24,000.00 | Flat | No trade |

### 1.4 Step 4: sizing (how many lots)

1. The bot reads the option's last traded price (LTP) twice over REST, 1 second apart, and sizes on the **lower** of the two prices. This protects against an opening spike in the first quote.
2. It uses the full available balance, with a **3% margin cushion**: lots = floor(available balance ÷ (LTP × 1.03 × 65)). Kite blocks margin for a market buy about 3% above the last price (on 28 Sep it asked ₹1,09,473 for an order worth ₹1,06,265 at the last price), so sizing on the raw price would get the first order refused.
3. Kite allows at most 25 lots per order, so a larger size is split into parallel orders (for example 29 lots → one order of 25 and one of 4). It is still one position.

Timing note: the two price reads take about 1 second, so the order usually reaches Kite at about 9:15:12, not exactly 9:15:11.000.

> Example: available balance ₹2,00,000. PE quotes are ₹101.00, then ₹100.00 one second later. The bot sizes on ₹100.00 × 1.03 = ₹103.00. One lot counts as 103 × 65 = ₹6,695, so 2,00,000 ÷ 6,695 = 29.9 → **29 lots (1,885 qty)**, sent as 25 + 4 lots.

### 1.5 Step 5: the entry order

- **NRML market buy.** It fills at the live price, not at a fixed limit, so it gets filled fast.
- Your actual entry price is the average fill price Kite reports. It can be a little different from the price used for sizing.

### 1.6 What happens if Kite says "insufficient funds"

The 3% cushion covers the usual extra margin, but the live price can still move between sizing and placement, so Kite can occasionally reject for margin.

1. The bot immediately retries with fewer lots:
   - If Kite quotes "Required" and "Available" amounts, the bot scales the size down in one step: new lots = floor(current lots × available ÷ required). It always drops at least 1 lot.
   - If Kite doesn't quote the amounts, it drops exactly 1 lot.
2. It keeps retrying instantly, with no deliberate pause, **until 9:15:15**.
3. If it still hasn't got in by 9:15:16, the 9:15 trade is skipped for the day. The 9:16 trade is not affected.

> Example: the bot tries 29 lots. Kite replies "Required: ₹2,01,500 · Available: ₹2,00,000". The scaled size is floor(29 × 2,00,000 ÷ 2,01,500) = floor(28.78) = **28 lots**, retried at once. If 28 is also rejected, it tries 27, and so on, until 9:15:15.

### 1.7 Partial fill

If some of the split orders fill and others are rejected (for example the 25-lot order fills but the 4-lot order is refused), the bot keeps what filled. It then tops up the missing lots, using the same downsize logic, **until 9:15:20**.

> Example: the target is 29 lots, but only the 25-lot order filled. The bot tries to buy 4 more lots. If 4 is refused for margin, it tries 3, then 2, and so on. It stops trying at 9:15:20 and manages whatever quantity it holds.

### 1.8 Exit 1: take-profit limit sell (the main exit)

The moment the buy fills, the bot places a resting **limit sell** for the whole quantity at:

**limit price = entry price × (1 + take-profit %), rounded to the nearest ₹0.05**

| Leg | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PE** (red 9:15) | 5% | 5% | 3% | 3% | 3% |
| **CE** (green 9:15) | 3% | 3% | 3% | 3% | 3% |

The % is profit on capital deployed (entry price × quantity), not a Nifty move.

> Example A (PE on a Monday): entry ₹100.00 × 1,885 qty = ₹1,88,500 deployed. Limit = 100 × 1.05 = **₹105.00**. If it fills, profit = 5 × 1,885 = **₹9,425** (5% of ₹1,88,500).
>
> Example B (PE on a Wednesday): same entry. Limit = 100 × 1.03 = **₹103.00**. Profit = **₹5,655** (3%).
>
> Example C (CE on any day): same entry. Limit = **₹103.00**. Profit = **₹5,655** (3%).
>
> Example D (rounding): entry ₹87.35 at 3% → 87.35 × 1.03 = 89.9705 → nearest ₹0.05 = **₹89.95**.

If Kite rejects the limit order, the bot retries straight away, up to 15 attempts. If it still can't place it, the market backup below still protects the target.

### 1.9 Exit 2: market backup

The bot also watches live unrealised P&L. If P&L reaches the same target (PE weekday % or CE 3%) but the limit sell hasn't filled, the bot cancels the limit and sells at market.

> Example: the limit sits at ₹105.00, the option trades at ₹105.10 for a moment, but your limit doesn't fill (queue or partial). Live P&L shows ≥ ₹9,425, so the bot cancels the limit and sells at market.

### 1.10 Exit 3: small-body exit at 9:16:01

This checks whether the whole 9:15 minute confirmed the move.

1. At 9:16:00 the bot seals the 9:15 close (last Nifty tick before 9:16:00).
2. If the 9:15 trade is still open and **|9:15 close − 9:15 open| < 5 points**, the exit is armed.
3. On the first Nifty tick in the 9:16:01 second, the bot cancels the take-profit limit and sells everything at market, whatever the P&L.

Why: the trade was bought because of the move at 9:15:10. If the full minute closes almost flat, that move has faded and the reason for the trade is gone.

> Example (PE): open 24,000.00. At 9:15:10 Nifty is 23,993 (red by 7), so the bot buys a PE. By 9:15:59 Nifty has bounced to 23,998, a body of only 2 points. The take-profit hasn't filled, so the PE is sold at market at 9:16:01.
>
> Counter-example: if the close had been 23,990 (body 10 points), nothing happens. The trade carries on with its take-profit, market backup, hard stop and 3:25 PM exit.

It applies the same way to CE trades; only the size of the body matters, not its direction.

When this exit is armed, the 9:16 trade is not marked as skipped, because the 9:15 trade is being closed at 9:16:01 anyway. In every other case where the 9:15 trade is still open at 9:16:00, the 9:16 trade is skipped for the day.

### 1.11 Exit 4: hard stop (from 10:00 AM)

From 10:00 AM, the bot exits at market if Nifty has moved **30 points against** the trade, measured from the entry spot:

- **PE:** exit when Nifty ≥ entry spot + 30
- **CE:** exit when Nifty ≤ entry spot − 30

Before 10:00 there is no hard stop.

> Example (PE): entry spot 23,990. From 10:00 the stop level is 24,020. If Nifty is at 24,035 at 9:45, nothing happens because the stop isn't active yet. If Nifty is 24,020 or higher at any time from 10:00, the bot sells at market.
>
> Example (CE): entry spot 24,012. The stop level is 23,982 from 10:00.

### 1.12 Exit 5: 3:25 PM square-off

Any 9:15 position still open at 3:25 PM is sold at market, whatever the P&L.

### 1.13 There is no trailing stop

Apart from the exits above, there is no option-price stop-loss and no trailing ladder. The trade either hits a take-profit, gets cut by the small-body exit or the hard stop, or runs until 3:25 PM.

### 1.14 9:15 trade, full worked example (a Monday)

1. 9:15:00.2: open = 24,000.00.
2. 9:15:04: ATM 24000 CE and PE are pre-resolved.
3. 9:15:09.9: last tick before 9:15:10 is 23,992.40, red by 7.60, so the decision is to buy the PE.
4. About 9:15:12: quotes are ₹101.00 and ₹100.00, so it sizes on ₹100 × 1.03 = ₹103. With a ₹2,00,000 balance that's 29 lots, sent as 25 + 4.
5. Fills at an average of ₹100.20, 1,885 qty, so ₹1,88,877 deployed.
6. Take-profit limit (Monday, PE, 5%): 100.20 × 1.05 = 105.21 → **₹105.20**.
7. 9:16:00: 9:15 close 23,985 (body 15), so no small-body exit.
8. At 9:22 the option reaches ₹105.20, the limit fills, and profit is about (105.20 − 100.20) × 1,885 = **₹9,425**.

---

## 2. The 9:16 trade (PE or CE at 9:16:01)

### 2.1 Entry decision: Δ of the full 9:15 candle

- **9:15 open:** the same first tick from 9:15:00 used by the 9:15 trade.
- **9:15 close:** the last Nifty WS tick strictly before 9:16:00, logged as the 9:15:59 close.
- **Δ = close − open.**

| Δ | Result |
|---|---|
| Flat (Δ = 0) | No trade |
| \|Δ\| < 15 | No trade |
| Red, \|Δ\| ≥ 15 | Buy ATM **PE** at 9:16:01 |
| Green, \|Δ\| ≥ 15 | Buy ATM **CE** at 9:16:01 |

> Examples (open = 24,000.00):
>
> | 9:15 close | Δ | Decision |
> |---|---|---|
> | 23,980.00 | −20 | **Buy PE** |
> | 23,985.00 | −15 (exactly) | **Buy PE** |
> | 23,990.00 | −10 | No trade |
> | 24,018.00 | +18 | **Buy CE** |
> | 24,015.00 | +15 (exactly) | **Buy CE** |
> | 24,009.00 | +9 | No trade |

**Blocked:** if the 9:15 trade is still open at 9:16:00, the 9:16 trade is skipped for the day. The exception is the small-body exit case in 1.10.

### 2.2 Pre-arming at 9:15:58

At 9:15:58 the bot looks up the ATM CE and PE strikes from the live spot and subscribes both options to the websocket. That way the 9:16:01 order doesn't need any slow REST calls.

### 2.3 Sizing at 9:16:01

At exactly 9:16:01.000 (a dedicated timer) the bot sizes the order on the **latest option websocket price** it already has for the chosen option. Both options have been streaming since 9:15:58, so there's no waiting for a new tick. If that price is more than 3 seconds old, it reads one REST quote instead.

Kite blocks margin for a market buy about 3% above the last price, so a full-balance order sized on the raw price would be refused. The bot therefore sizes as if the premium were **3% higher**.

> Example: latest PE price ₹78.20, balance ₹1,17,010. Sizing price = 78.20 × 1.03 = ₹80.55. One lot = 80.55 × 65 = ₹5,236, so 1,17,010 ÷ 5,236 = 22.3 → **22 lots**.

### 2.4 The entry order

- **NRML market buy** at 9:16:01, split into 25-lot orders if larger (up to 9 orders sent at the same moment). There's no limit price and nothing to wait for; it fills at the market price.
- The bot checks for the fill every 0.2 seconds.
- **Retries until 9:16:30:** if an attempt fails, the bot re-reads prices and tries again until 9:16:30. After that there is no 9:16 trade that day.

### 2.5 Partial fill and margin short

- **Partial fill:** the bot keeps what filled and tops up the missing lots until 9:16:30.
- **Insufficient margin:** it steps the size down and retries instantly, with no pause (for example 25 → 24 → 23), scaling in one jump when Kite quotes the required and available amounts.

> Example: the bot tries 26 lots as 25 + 1. The 25-lot order fills and the 1-lot order is rejected for margin. It keeps the 25 lots and tries to top up 1 lot until 9:16:30.

### 2.6 Exit 1: take-profit limit sell

The moment the entry fills, a resting **limit sell** is placed at:

**limit price = entry price × (1 + take-profit %), rounded to the nearest ₹0.05**

| Leg | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PE** (red 9:15) | 5% | 7% | 5% | 5% | 7% |
| **CE** (green 9:15) | 3% | 3% | 3% | 3% | 3% |

Note that the 9:16 PE percentages differ from the 9:15 PE percentages.

> Example A (PE on a Tuesday): entry ₹64.75 × 1,625 qty (25 lots) = ₹1,05,219 deployed. Limit = 64.75 × 1.07 = 69.28 → **₹69.30**. Profit if filled = 4.55 × 1,625 = about ₹7,394 (7%, a touch more after rounding).
>
> Example B (PE on a Monday): limit = 64.75 × 1.05 = 67.99 → **₹68.00**. Profit about ₹5,281 (5%).
>
> Example C (CE on any day): limit = 64.75 × 1.03 = 66.69 → **₹66.70**. Profit about ₹3,169 (3%).

If Kite rejects the limit order, the bot retries straight away, up to 15 attempts.

### 2.7 Exit 2: market backup

This works the same as the 9:15 trade. If unrealised P&L reaches the target % but the limit hasn't filled, the bot cancels the limit and sells at market.

### 2.8 Exit 3: parallel Nifty index exit (market sell)

This runs at the same time as the take-profit limit; whichever is hit first closes the trade. It watches the Nifty index, not the option price.

Three reference ticks decide the target:

- **9:15:59 close:** the last Nifty tick inside the 9:15:59 second.
- **9:16:00 open:** the first Nifty tick inside the 9:16:00 second.
- **9:16:59 close:** the last Nifty tick inside the 9:16:59 second.

Any difference counts, even 0.05: an open slightly below the 9:15:59 close is red, slightly above is green. An open exactly equal to the 9:15:59 close counts as the same colour as the 9:15 candle for that trade (the 12-point tier).

#### PE trade (red 9:15)

| Condition | Target (until 9:17:00) |
|---|---|
| 9:16:00 open ≤ 9:15:59 close (both candles red) | Nifty ≤ entry spot **− 12** |
| 9:16:00 open > 9:15:59 close (green gap at 9:16) | Nifty ≤ entry spot **− 8** |

**From 9:17:00:** if the 9:16 minute closed green (9:16:59 close > 9:15:59 close), the target moves to Nifty ≤ entry spot **− 6**. Otherwise the original −12 or −8 target stays.

> Example (PE):
> - 9:15:59 close = 23,980.00. 9:16:00 first tick = 23,978.50, which is lower, so both candles are red.
> - Entry spot at fill = 23,976.00, so the **target is 23,964.00** (−12).
> - If instead the 9:16:00 tick had been 23,981.00 (higher, a green gap), the **target would be 23,968.00** (−8).
> - At 9:16:59 the last tick is 23,985.00, above 23,980.00, so the 9:16 minute closed green. **From 9:17:00 the target becomes 23,970.00** (−6).
> - If the 9:16:59 tick had been 23,975.00 (below 23,980), there would be no change and the target stays at 23,964 (or 23,968).

#### CE trade (green 9:15), the mirror image

| Condition | Target (until 9:17:00) |
|---|---|
| 9:16:00 open ≥ 9:15:59 close (both candles green) | Nifty ≥ entry spot **+ 12** |
| 9:16:00 open < 9:15:59 close (red gap at 9:16) | Nifty ≥ entry spot **+ 8** |

**From 9:17:00:** if the 9:16 minute closed red (9:16:59 close < 9:15:59 close), the target moves to Nifty ≥ entry spot **+ 6**. Otherwise the original +12 or +8 target stays.

> Example (CE):
> - 9:15:59 close = 24,018.00. 9:16:00 first tick = 24,019.00, which is higher, so both candles are green.
> - Entry spot at fill = 24,020.00, so the **target is 24,032.00** (+12).
> - If instead the 9:16:00 tick had been 24,017.50 (lower, a red gap), the **target would be 24,028.00** (+8).
> - At 9:16:59 the last tick is 24,010.00, below 24,018.00, so the 9:16 minute closed red. **From 9:17:00 the target becomes 24,026.00** (+6).

Why the target shrinks: when the second candle goes against the trade, the move is weaker, so the bot settles for a smaller, quicker index target.

Edge cases:

- If Nifty is already beyond the new 6-point target at 9:17:00, the exit fires on the next check.
- If no Nifty tick arrives in the 9:16:00 second, the bot uses the entry spot as the 9:16 open.
- If no Nifty tick arrives in the 9:15:59 second, the index exit isn't armed for that day. The trade then relies on the take-profit, market backup, hard stop and 3:25 PM exits. This is rare, because Nifty normally ticks several times a second.

### 2.9 Exit 4: hard stop (from 10:00 AM)

This is the same as the 9:15 trade:

- **PE:** exit at market when Nifty ≥ entry spot + 30
- **CE:** exit at market when Nifty ≤ entry spot − 30

It's only active from 10:00 AM and runs alongside the other exits; the first to trigger wins.

### 2.10 Exit 5: 3:25 PM square-off

Any 9:16 position still open at 3:25 PM is sold at market.

### 2.11 There is no trailing stop

There is no option-price stop-loss or trailing ladder. The trade closes on the first of the take-profit limit, market backup, index exit, hard stop or 3:25 PM.

### 2.12 How an exit actually fires (both trades)

- The index exit and hard stop are checked on **every Nifty websocket tick**, about 4 a second. A separate **1-second safety check** repeats them even if the rest of the bot stalls. They never wait behind a Kite request.
- On the tick that crosses the level, the bot cancels the take-profit limit and sells the **whole position at market** in parallel orders (max 25 lots each, up to 9 at once). Fills are checked every 0.2 seconds.
- If the take-profit limit was confirmed unfilled within the last 3 seconds and Kite accepted the cancel, the sell goes out without waiting for a holdings check. Holdings are verified straight after, and if a fill slipped in and the account ends up short, the excess is bought back at once.
- Kite read requests (orders, positions, quotes) give up after 6 seconds per attempt and retry, so a stuck request can't freeze the bot.
- If any bot step is busy for more than 20 seconds, the session log shows `Bot loop stalled … at "<step>"`.

### 2.13 9:16 trade, full worked example (a Tuesday, PE)

1. 9:15 open 24,000.00, 9:15 close (last tick before 9:16:00) 23,980.00, so Δ = −20, red, and |Δ| ≥ 15. Buy PE.
2. 9:15:58: ATM 24000 CE and PE are resolved and subscribed.
3. 9:16:00 first Nifty tick is 23,978.50, which is ≤ the 9:15:59 close of 23,980.00, so both candles are red and the index tier is −12.
4. 9:16:01.000: the latest PE websocket price is ₹64.75, so it sizes on 64.75 × 1.03 and sends a market buy. Fills at an average of ₹64.75: 25 lots = 1,625 qty.
5. Entry spot at fill is 23,976.00, so the index target is 23,964.00.
6. Take-profit limit (Tuesday, PE, 7%): 64.75 × 1.07 → **₹69.30**.
7. 9:16:59 last tick is 23,972.00, below 23,980, so the minute did not close green and there's no retarget.
8. 9:19: Nifty touches 23,964.00 before the option reaches ₹69.30, so the index exit fires. The bot cancels the take-profit limit and sells at market.
